I’m a budding Data Scientist adept in collecting, analyzing, and transforming data into insights. My background in Information Technology and Data Analytics provides me with extensive analytical skills to wrestle with large & complex data. I am currently pursuing a Master of Science degree in Business Analytics at Santa Clara University and my passion for Data Science allows me to provide data-driven, action-oriented solutions to challenging business problems. 

With deep expertise in Machine Learning, Data Mining, and Statistical Analysis, I’m also proficient in Marketing Analytics, NLP, Deep Learning, and Data Visualization. I am excited to walk the uncanny valley of research and development, and I enjoy learning new things while thriving in challenging environments.

The world today is facing a situation of data deluge, and I believe, through my passion and skills, I can unlock its significant potential and aid businesses into efficient forecasting and planning.

When I’m not studying/working 📚, I love to travel ✈️, explore the world 🏕️, sketch 🎨 and workout 🏋️‍♂️.
